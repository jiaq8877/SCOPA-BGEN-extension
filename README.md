# SCOPA (BGEN extension)

SCOPA (Software for COrrelated Phenotype Analysis) is a software that implements the reverse regression model to perform GWAS analysis of multiple correlated phenotypes. The mathematical model and its example usage is documented in the paper SCOPA and META-SCOPA: software for the analysis and aggregation of genome-wide association studies of multiple correlated phenotypes (https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-016-1437-3).

The installation instructions and documentation can be found on: https://genomics.ut.ee/en/tools

This project aims to adapt SCOPA to support the BGEN format (https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/bgen_format/) to make use of the data from the UK Biobank (BGEN v1.2).
